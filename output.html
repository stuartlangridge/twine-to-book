<p>It's another gleeful day at Freaky Towers. The sun is shining, the grass is griz, and you have the whole wide world ahead of you.

You can attempt to find a vulnerability in some popular software (turn to 3), catch up on Reddit (turn to 4), or have a cocktail on the balcony (turn to 9).</p>
<h1>2</h1>
<p>Bad! bad bad bad boy. You have lost. Also, you have proved that you're not Freakyclown.</p>
<h1>3</h1>
<p>Finding vulnerabilities is part of what you do; that's what pen-testing is. (Yes, yes, you've heard all the jokes about how it's actually just testing pens. It is not.) There's so much bad software out there, and only one Freakyclown.

Would you like to look for simple SQL injection issues in forum software (turn to 7), check out a couple of slightly dodgy fora for tips (turn to 11), or release a previously discovered vulnerability (turn to 6)? Or you might want to look around your living room (turn to 1) to do a new thing entirely.</p>
<h1>4</h1>
<p>Ah, Reddit. Home of the moron. After looking at a million cat pictures, you do grab a couple of ideas that might help you attempt to find a vulnerability in some popular software (turn to 3). Failing that, take a glance around your living room (turn to 1) for something fun to do.</p>
<h1>5</h1>
<p>Bad! bad bad bad boy. You have lost. Also, you have proved that you're not Freakyclown.</p>
<h1>6</h1>
<p>Time to put some stuff out there. You've got a whole stack of things you haven't had a chance to write up yet.

Do you plan to start exploiting this new security hole for yourself (turn to 5), responsibly advise the vendor (turn to 8), post to a well-known security list without advising the vendor (turn to 10), or sell the hole to some suspect gentlemen of your acquaintance (turn to 2)?</p>
<h1>7</h1>
<p>Well, that was depressingly easy to do; looking around you have no trouble whatsoever in finding a glaringly massive hole in a popular but appallingly-written piece of forum software, in code that probably hasn't been touched since about 1998. This is like shooting fish in a bucket, except the bucket doesn't complain about how it's a volunteer and therefore can't be expected to do security work. Ah well. A random member of the public's cookies' loss is your gain, as ever. That goes into the stack of things you've discovered, now.

So, you can release a previously discovered vulnerability (turn to 6) or take a glance around your living room (turn to 1) for some fun.</p>
<h1>8</h1>
<p>Of course you'll do this responsibly. When the vendor ignores all your emails then posting publicly normally works to actually wake them up, but some people (most, these days) acknowledge and get things fixed. Ahh, it's a fun life.

You have won.
</p>
<h1>9</h1>
<p>There's nothing like the sense of a cool vodka Collins to improve one's day. Even if it is half ten in the morning. Fortunately, this sort of thing stimulates your more creative neurons, and you've got an idea how to attempt to find a vulnerability in some popular software (turn to 3). Behind you, your living room (turn to 1) beckons you with other untold delights.</p>
<h1>10</h1>
<p>Now, that's not really responsible disclosure, is it? Waggy finger of disapproval for you. You have lost.</p>
<h1>11</h1>
<p>Interesting. There are a couple of decent tips here, one of which gives you an idea for where look for simple SQL injection issues in forum software (turn to 7) that they mention, and another of which impinges on something you worked out a while ago and never got around to doing anything with. Perhaps you should release a previously discovered vulnerability (turn to 6)?</p>
