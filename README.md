twine-to-book
=============

A stupid demo for @__freakyclown__ to show how to write a Choose Your Own Adventure book using Twine.

The file twinepage.html was generated using Twine 2's browser-based client at http://twinery.org/2/. Just run `python twine-to-book.py twinepage.html output.html` and get a new HTML page which is formatted like a CYOA book (or maybe a Fighting Fantasy book, who can tell?)

Obviously not a proper thing, but it demonstrates the possibility.
